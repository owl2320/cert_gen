#this is a shiity project and i just did this bcuz i though why not automate some stuff for my dad to use on
his work but if it frustrates you at how inefficient and garbage it it is im sorry if it helps yhou which it most definitely wont thank you
anyways to use it just see what the ui points at and youll undersatnd everything this is made using mostly 3rd part libs like python-docx and docxtpl
i use seperate extractor functions for this for different file formats and even added bangla encoding bcuz it is still not alot but common in bd


gen cert
this func responsible for generating all certs with given info

gencsv or docx or wih bijoy encoding
these just extract info and pass it to the progressbar and the generate func
i used propably re i think to cleanly get all the texts well as cleanly i can get

gui
i used ctk for a bit of modern look tkinterdnd2 for drag and drop and other gui based features
i also added the theme changer to make this peice of shit feel fancy

all this are responsible for creating the work of garbage this code is
thanks. or am I?
